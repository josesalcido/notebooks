Retrieve your Watson Machine Learning service instance credentials\n\nTo run the code samples in this notebook, you must supply information, such as the URL, apikey, and scoring endpoint variables from your environment. The details on how to do this are described in the following steps:\n\n1. Log in to your **IBM Cloud** account and, from the dashboard, select the **IBM Watson Machine Learning** service that you created.\n2. Click **Service credentials**.\n3. Click **View credentials** and then copy the values from the **URL**, **apikey**, and **instance_id** fields to the corresponding `URL`, `apikey`, and `instance_id` variables in the code cells in this notebook. \n4. To find the scoring endpoint, log in to **Watson Studio**.\n5. Click **Projects** and from the list, select your project.\n6. On the **Deployments** tab, open the model deployment.\n7. On the **Implementation** tab, copy the  **Scoring End-Point** and paste it into the `scoring_endpoint` variable in this notebook.\n\nAfter updating the first two code cells with your information, run those two cells."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "# Add credentials for your Watson Machine Learning service instance \nwml_credentials={\n  \"url\": \"insert_your_URL_here\",\n  \"apikey\": \"insert_your_apikey_here\",\n  \"instance_id\": \"insert_your_instance_id_here\"\n}", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "# Add scoring endpoint for model deployment\nscoring_endpoint = 'insert_your_scoring_endpoint_here'", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### Task 2.
